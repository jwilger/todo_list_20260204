Memento may have useful information about: Debugging (similar issues solved before?), Architecture (patterns or decisions documented?), Tools (known quirks, workarounds, or configurations?), Conventions (project-specific patterns or preferences?). To search: Use mcp__memento__semantic_search with your task description as the query. This is a gentle reminder - proceed without searching if the work is novel or memento isn't available."
